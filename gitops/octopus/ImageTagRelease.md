# Octopus Deploy: Container Image Tag Release Pipeline

In addition to the [manifest generation pipeline](https://github.com/Microsoft/bedrock/blob/master/gitops/azure-devops/ManifestGeneration.md), Octopus Deploy can help extend the pipeline by providing a way to achieve container promotion.

If you are new to Octopus Deploy, we **strongly** recommend setting up the [manifest generation pipeline](OctopusDeploy.md) using Octopus Deploy first. This is because certain parts of the guide will assume that you already have part of your Octopus Infrastructure (e.g. Deployment Targets, Target Statuses, Environments, etc.) in place.

This guide will assist you with constructing the following image tagging release pipeline:

![Image Tag Release Pipeline](images/image-tag-release-pipeline.png)

## Prerequisites

1. An _Octopus Server_ and an _Octopus account_. The [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/octopus.octopusdeploy) supports Octopus Deploy under a 45-day free trial, and will serve as a good starting point for deploying your first Octopus Server. For more information on gettings started, please visit [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/bedrock/blob/master/gitops/octopus/OctopusDeploy.md#getting-started).
2. _High Level Deployment Description_: Either your own [Fabrikate](https://github.com/Microsoft/fabrikate) high level definition for your deployment or a sample one of ours.  We provide a [sample HLD repo](https://github.com/samiyaakhtar/aks-deploy-source) that builds upon the [cloud-native](https://github.com/timfpark/fabrikate-cloud-native) Fabrikate definition. The one used in this example can be found [here](https://github.com/yradsmikham/fabrikate-go-server).

## Setup

### 1. Create a new Octopus Project

Assuming this is not your first time using Octopus Deploy, let's start off by creating a new project.

![Create a new Octopus project](images/octo-create-new-proj.png)

![Name your project](images/octo-create-new-proj-2.png)

### 2. Define Deployment Process

You should be taken to the project page where you have the option to define your Deployment Process.

![Define Deployment Process](images/octo-define-process.png)

Add a `Script` step.

![Add Process](images/octo-process-script.png)

![Add a bash script](images/octo-add-script.png)

Create a step using a bash script called `Download Scripts`. The purpose of this step is to download the `build.sh` from the offcial [Microsoft/Bedrock](https://github.com/Microsoft/bedrock/blob/master/gitops/azure-devops/build.sh) repo.

You want to configure the execution location to run on each deployment target with a selected role (bash scripts cannot run on the Octopus Server). If you have not created a role before, you can create a new role by simply typing one in.

![Create a Download Script step](images/octo-download-scripts.png)

Next, under the Script section, select `Inline source code`, and paste in the following bash script:

```
# Download build.sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/bedrock/master/gitops/azure-devops/build.sh > build.sh
chmod +x ./build.sh
```

Again, this will download the `build.sh` from the Microsoft/Bedrock repo, which will be sourced in the next step.

![Inline source code](images/octo-download-scripts-2.png)

On the top right corner, click on `Configure Features`, which will provide a pop-up to enable specific features for the script. Select `Substitute Variables in Files` since the `build.sh` _does_ involve using environment variables. Then, click `OK`.

![Enable Features](images/octo-enable-features.png)

Do not forget to `Save` your step!

![Save](images/octo-save.png)

Navigate back to the Process page to add another Step.

![Add another Process Step](images/octo-add-another-step.png)

![Create another Release step](images/octo-run-release-step.png)

Again, you will add another bash script step, but instead the script will execute the following:

```
# Define Environment Variables
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=#{ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET}
REPO=#{REPO}
BRANCH=#{BRANCH}
COMMIT_MESSAGE=#{COMMIT_MESSAGE}
YAML_PATH=#{YAML_PATH}
YAML_PATH_VALUE=#{YAML_PATH_VALUE}
YAML_PATH_2=#{YAML_PATH_2}
YAML_PATH_VALUE_2=#{YAML_PATH_VALUE_2}
SUBCOMPONENT=#{SUBCOMPONENT}

# Reset Environment
rm -rf fab*

# Source build.sh
. build.sh --source-only

# Initialization
verify_access_token
init
helm init
get_os

# Fabrikate
get_fab_version
download_fab

# Clone HLD repo
git_connect

echo "FAB SET"
fab set --subcomponent ${SUBCOMPONENT} ${YAML_PATH}=${YAML_PATH_VALUE} ${YAML_PATH_2}=${YAML_PATH_VALUE_2}

echo "GIT STATUS"
git pull origin master
git status
git fetch

echo "GIT ADD"
git add -A

# Set git identity
git config user.email "admin@azuredevops.com"
git config user.name "Automated Account"

echo "GIT COMMIT"
echo "COMMIT MESSAGE: $COMMIT_MESSSAGE"
git commit -m $COMMIT_MESSAGE

echo "GIT PUSH"
git_push
```

![Source Inline](images/octo-run-release-inline.png)

Hit `Save`.

Project variables need to be specified in order for the scripts to run. For this pipeline, there are a few variables that are considered:

```
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: the personal access token from your git repository

COMMIT_MESSAGE: custom message used when committing and pushing to git

OctopusUseRawScript: parameter that allows raw scripting to be used in the Deployment Target

REPO: the link to the HLD repo (e.g. https://github.com/yradsmikham/fabrikate-go-server)

BRANCH: the branch of the Fabrikate HLD repo (e.g. master)

SUBCOMPONENT: the subcomponent within your Fabrikate HLD that should be manipulated

YAML_PATH: the yaml path to the subkey to set (e.g. data.replicas)

YAML_PATH_VALUE: the value to the subkey
```

**Note**: The personal access token is used to commit and push to the Fabrikate HLD repo. (This variable can be censored by right-clicking on the value column and changing the "type" to sensitive.)

**Note**: In Octopus Deploy, variables cannot have values that contain spaces or special characters. Thus, the `COMMIT_MESSAGE` must be a single string or if using spaces and/or special characters, you will need to hardcode the message in the inline source code.

**Note**: It is important to enable [Raw Octopus](https://octopus.com/blog/trying-raw-octopus), or "Raw Scripting" for this pipeline because it is a default configuration to have deployments run [Calamari](https://octopus.com/docs/api-and-integration/calamari) when using Octopus Deploy, and this will interfere with "resetting" the Deployment Target. For this reason, raw scripting is used to allow the script steps to execute directly through the opened SSH connection without any extra wrapping or bootstrapping that comes naturally with Octopus. To do this, it is important to add the variable `OctopusUseRawScript` and set it to `True`.

**Note**: The `fab set` command allows you to specify as many yaml path values as needed. In this example, we have set two examples: (1) image repository, and (2) image tag. This will translate to: `image.repository=saakhtaregistry.azurecr.io/jackson-ui` and `image.tag=v0.2`. Notice that the variable `YAML_PATH_VALUE` is configured to be a [prompted variable](https://octopus.com/docs/deployment-process/variables/prompted-variables), which means that the variable is not known, and the value for the variable will be provided during the Release time. However, in situations where the value is not provided during the Release deployment, then the default value of `v0.2` will be used.

![Variables](images/octo-release-variables.png)

**OPTIONAL** (please proceed if you already have a [manifest generation pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/blob/master/gitops/octopus/OctopusDeploy.md) in place): Navigate to the Process page again to add one last step. This time, add "Deploy a Release" step, which will create a new release of another Octopus project.

![Initiate HLD to Manifests Release](images/octo-deploy-release-step.png)

Name your step, and select the manifest generation project to deploy (e.g. hld to manifests). Click `Save`.

![Configure Deploy Release Step](images/octo-deploy-release-config.png)

This optional step is useful for kicking off another Octopus Release, specifically the [manifest generation pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/blob/master/gitops/octopus/OctopusDeploy.md).

### 3. Create and Deploy Release

You're now at the point to create and deploy a Release! Navigate to `Releases` on the left side panel and click on `Create Release`.

![Create a Release](images/octo-create-release.png)

This is optional, but you can specify notes for the Release.

![Add Release Notes](images/octo-release-notes.png)

Be sure to click `Update Variables` to ensure that your environment variables exist. It is important to note that if changes are made to the Project Variables, you will need to update the variables in the Release snapshot before deploying.

![Release Snapshot](images/octo-release-snapshot.png)

When you are finished, click `Deploy`, and this will deploy to environments that you have specified.

![Prepare to Deploy](images/octo-deploy.png)

Your deployment should be in progress now.

![Deployment in Progress](images/octo-deploying.png)

You can track the progress of your deployment and view logs on the `Task Log` tab.

![View Tasks Logs](images/octo-task-logs.png)

### 4. Promotion

When your Release runs successfully, you have the option to promote to the next environment (e.g. qa).

![Deploy to QA](images/octo-deploy-to-qa.png)

![Deploy to QA](images/octo-qa-deploy.png)

**Note**: You will need to prepare your `qa` environment before deploying if you have not already done so. This means that you should have Deployment Targets specified and labeled `qa` if used in your `qa` environment.

## Enable Automatic Release Creation and Auto-Deploy

Often, users may find it helpful to invoke a release creation automatically, and Octopus provides the functionality to do that. To learn more about it, please visit [Automatic Release Creation](https://octopus.com/docs/deployment-process/project-triggers/automatic-release-creation).

In this example, we will use a NuGet package (e.g. Test.App) that was uploaded to the built-in package repository in Octopus by TeamCity. For more information on how to package and push a package in TeamCity to Octopus, please visit [connect to Octopus](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/blob/octo-doc-nuget/gitops/teamcity/ConnectToOctopus.md).

![Upload NuGet Package](images/octo-nuget-package.png)

Go to Process, and add a new step, "Deploy a Package".

![Add Step Deploy a Package](images/octo-deploy-package.png)

Name your Step, add a Target Role, and select the appropriate package to deploy. Hit `Save`.

![Select package to deploy](images/octo-select-package.png)

Reorder the steps so that "Deploy Test.App" is the first step. This is because you want the upload of the "Test.App" package to trigger the process of the automatic release creation.

![Reorder Steps](images/octo-reorder-steps.png)

Your Process should look something like this now:

![Process](images/octo-new-process.png)

Navigate to `Triggers` on the left panel. On the right, under "Automatic Release Creation", click on `Setup`.

![Setup ACR](images/octo-acr-setup.png)

Select the Package step that you just create (e.g. Deploy Test.App) so that when a new version of the package is uploaded to the Octopus repository, it will automatically create a new release.

![Select Package for ACR](images/octo-acr-setup-2.png)

Now, go to `Library` > `Lifecycles`. Add a new Lifecycle.

![Add a Lifecycle](images/octo-add-lifecycle.png)

Name your lifecycle, and proceed to add a phase.

![Add a Phase in Lifecycle](images/octo-add-phase.png)

Select the appropriate environment(s) to deploy automatically when a release enters the phase.

![Configure Phase Environment](images/octo-lifecycle-add-env.png)

Click `Save`.

Now your project should automatically create a release **and** deploy when a new version of the "Test.App" package is uploaded to the built-in Octopus repository by an external CI process like TeamCity.

**NOTE:** If this is your first time setting up automatic release creation, you may need to **manually** create a release first after the new step has been added and configured.

## TeamCity

The TeamCity [image tag release](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/blob/master/gitops/teamcity/ImageTagRelease.md) pipeline works hand in hand with this Octopus pipeline. When you do have a TeamCity pipeline setup, it is worth visting how to [trigger Octopus from TeamCity](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/blob/master/gitops/teamcity/ConnectToOctopus.md). With the [manifest generation pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/blob/master/gitops/octopus/OctopusDeploy.md), you should be able to complete the entire GitOps CI/CD workflow using TeamCity and Octopus Deploy.
